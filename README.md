# Spotify Album Searcher

## Project Overview

The **Spotify Album Searcher** is a React-based web application that allows users to search for any music artist and retrieve a list of their albums using the *Spotify Developer API*. The application demonstrates integration with third-party APIs, use of essential frontend libraries like *Axios* and *Bootstrap*, and showcases a clean component-based structure for maintainable code development.

This project is ideal for users who want to explore how frontend technologies interact with public APIs, and how to build simple yet effective music-related search tools.
